# Project Title

This project demonstrates the use of the `transformers` library for text generation and summarization, integrated with `langchain` and `langchain-huggingface` for creating a language model pipeline.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` for package management

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Install `torch` and `torchvision`:
    ```sh
    pip install torch torchvision
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

2. Follow the prompts to input a topic and age for generating detailed explanations.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that sets up the text generation pipeline and handles user input.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

## Example

```sh
Topic: Machine Learning
Age: 10
```

The script will generate a detailed explanation of the topic suitable for the specified age.
